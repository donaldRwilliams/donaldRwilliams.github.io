The methods are organized around two general approaches for Bayesian inference: (1) estimation and (2) hypothesis testing. The computationally intensive tasks (e.g., custom MCMC samplers) are written in c++. The Bayes factors are computed with the R package BFpack (see below). There is full support for continuous, binary, ordinal, and mixed data (via a Gaussian copula graphical model).\r\n\r\n CRAN Website\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nblsmeta: Bayesian Location-Scale Meta-Analysis\r\n\r\n\r\nThe goal of {blsmeta} is to provide a user-friendly interface for Bayesian meta-analysis, including fixed-effects, two-level, and three-level (for dependent effect sizes) random-effects models. Additionally, a key feature of {blsmeta} is “scale” modeling, which allows for predicting the variance components with moderators (e.g., perhaps between-study variance is not constant across studies). As a result, heterogeneity statistics and prediction intervals are then a function of those same moderators, thereby opening the door to better understanding heterogeneity in meta-analysis.\r\n\r\n GitHub\r\n\r\n\r\nContributor\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
