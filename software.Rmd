### BGGM: Bayesian Gaussian Graphical Models
:::float-left

<img src="images/bggm_hex.jpg" width="150px">


The {**BGGM**} R package is a collection of tools for making Bayesian 
inference in Gaussian graphical models. The methods are organized around two general approaches for Bayesian inference: (1) estimation and (2) hypothesis testing. The computationally intensive tasks (e.g., custom MCMC samplers) are written in `c++` via the `R` package **Rcpp** [@eddelbuettel2011rcpp] and the `c++` library **Armadillo** [@sanderson2016armadillo]. The Bayes factors are computed with the `R` package **BFpack** [@mulder2019bfpack].  There is full support for continuous, binary, ordinal,
and mixed data (via a Gaussian copula graphical model).

### blsmeta: Bayesian Location-Scale Meta-Analysis
:::float-left


<img src="images/blsmeta_hex.png" width="250px">

The goal of {**blsmeta**} is to provide a user-friendly interface for
Bayesian meta-analysis, including fixed-effects, two-level, 
and three-level (for dependent effect sizes) 
random-effects models. Additionally, a key feature of {**blsmeta**} is "scale" modeling, which allows for predicting the variance components with moderators 
(e.g., perhaps between-study variance is not constant across studies). 
As a result, heterogeneity statistics and prediction intervals are then a function of those same moderators, thereby opening the door to **better
understanding heterogeneity in meta-analysis**.
